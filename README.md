# simple-web-server-c
I don't understand the web. I don't understand servers. I've never made anything in c. I don't understand git or github. I don't understand markdown documents. This can be fixed. This readme will be split between notes on what I learn (in general) and documentation on this project. 

## the project

## my notes

### preface

Below is all the things I've learned throughout this project. I wrote these by hand and then transcribed them here. I will give a general overview of the way I take notes and, in general, learn things. Understand, I am not a bright man. At the age of 24, working as an IT specialist, and having a bachelor's in computer science, I hardly understood fractions a year ago (specifically performing arithemetic with them. I am teaching myself algebra at the moment.) I never knew how to learn things in a way that made me want to take it beyond "just enough". I have found a new way to learn things. 

I pick a project and have to research every aspect of a subject to understand it. If I see a term I don't recognize, I research it, and if that brings on even more terms, I research those. I figure out why it exists and why it is picked over alternatives. I go in depth with it to the point of redundancy. Because of this, I gain a firm understanding of the tools I'm using and the domain I'm in. 

However, this brings on notes that can go on and on and on, making me seem stupid to anyone who knows the subject. I am not afraid seeming stupid, I am afraid of not knowing what I am doing. I am afraid of having a level of ignorance that disables my work ethic and agency. 

I am making these notes public in case anyone comes across it and thinks they need to know anything before doing things. I don't know anything right now. Everything I make a note on is something I did not have a full understanding on before I started this project. In the first section, you will see an explanation on c++'s file structure, what a header is, and what source code is. Before this project, I was that ignorant. I damn near don't deserve my degree nor my job. I want better than my degree and my job. I am no longer that ignorant.

### notes software engineering

I chose C as my starting language because I want to actually understand how it all works. I don't want the abstractions that allow me to "skip" things. I intend to occasionally make something in assembly as well.

### git and github

A pull request is a request to merge proposed code with a branch. This is done before a push (merge) into the code and prompts review from others on the project. 

A commit is a bit like saving your game. It's version control, where if you make something that break/corrupts or if your code is deleted, there is a save point to revert to. 

I have stared using terminal commands to control git. This is simpler than using the GUI for several reasons, but mroe than anything, consistency.

github's codespaces is probably the best ide i've used. i think when it comes to software i use, my preferences are decided by reliability and performance (like everyone else in the world.) It's not that I dislike most software, but most software "feels" bloated. I'm not technically proficient enough to explain why or even if it's true.
